    'Hello ! I am an software engineer and a web developer. For the last few years I have been working on Symfony APIs as a backend developer 💻 and on Vuejs web applications as a fronted developer 👩‍💻. I really like having experience on both back and frontend and I hope my jobs will always allow me to have a foot on both sides 😌.',
    'Coding is a hobby for a long time now and I absolutely love it because of all the creativity and learning it implies. I created this tiny web version of my resume with Vuejs because I thought it would be cool and I hope you will enjoy it too ! 😁 Please do not hesitate to send me a mail 📮 : penaguinleo@gmail.com',
